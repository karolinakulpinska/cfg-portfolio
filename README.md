# Karolina Kulpinska - CFG Intro to Web Dev - Final Project - Web Portfolio

## Description

As a final project of The Intro to Web Dev Kickstarter by CodeFirstGirls I have decided to design and code my personal portfolio website so that it meets challenge's criteria:

The website should include:
* A minimum of 2 HTML web pages and one external CSS file;
* A website wireframe;
* A CSS framework (in this case Favicon);
* All links should be working;
* Basic user interaction (ie: hover, submit form, action on click);
* Adhere to UI/UX rules.

I've also made sure that the application:
* loads with no errors;
* has effective use of classes and IDs;
* is interactive (JavaScript);
* follows best practices for file structure and naming conventions as well as class/id naming conventions, indentation, quality comments, etc.
